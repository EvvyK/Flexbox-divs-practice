                <p> The female Surinam Toad lays up to 100 eggs, which are then distributed over her back. Her skin swells around the eggs until they become embedded in a honeycomb-like structure. After 12 to 20 weeks, fully formed young toads emerge by pushing out through the membrane covering the toad's back. </p>

                <p> The Wood Frog of North America actually freezes in the winter and is reanimated in the spring. When temperatures fall, the wood frog's body begins to shut down, and its breathing, heartbeat and muscle movements stop. The water in the frog's cells freezes and is replaced with glucose and urea to keep cells from collapsing. When there's a thaw, the frog's warms up, its body functions resume and it hops off like nothing ever happened. </p>

                <p> When Darwin's Frog tadpoles hatch, a male frog swallows the tadpoles. He keeps the tiny amphibians in his vocal sac for about 60 days to allow them to grow. He then proceeds to cough up tiny, fully formed frogs. </p>
